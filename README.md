# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## App 

Link to the deployed version of the app: https://lauranews.netlify.app/

A C.R.U.D application from a front end perspective. LauraNews is a news, web content rating and discussion website. LauraNews has articles which are divided into topics, and each article has user-curated ratings from upvotes and downvotes using the API. As well as browsing articles and topics, users can comment on articles.

The app makes use of an api I built which can be found here: https://github.com/lauPattes/laura-news
Available endpoints for the api being used can be found on this repo's wiki page: https://github.com/lauPattes/fe-nc-news/wiki/Avaiable-endpoints
